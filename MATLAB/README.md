MATLAB version of the example.
==============================

# Pre-requisites:
- Install CasADi, following the instruction [here](https://web.casadi.org/get/).

# Run the code:
- Just run `main.m`.

# A couple of notes:
- `main.m` contains the main script to formulate and solve the trajectory optimization problem. Running this script should take about 1-2s. Different pre-defined walking styles can be generated by adjusting the variable `selected_gait`.
- To participate in our challenge, set the variable `challenge` to `true` (see last section of `main.m`).
- If you get troubles with getting the code to run, please post an issue on Github or contact Antoine (afalisse@stanford.edu).

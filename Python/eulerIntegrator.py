'''
This function returns the integration error, following a backward Euler
integration scheme. Constraints in the optimization problem impose this
error to be nul.

If x is the state value at time t, then xplus is the state value at t+1.
The backward Euler equation can be formulated as:
u(t+1) = (x(t+1) - x(t))/dt, and therefore the error is given by:
error = (x(t+1) - x(t)) - u(t+1)dt.
